Dear Optiver HR Team,

\vspace{30pt}

My name is Nicholas Lambourne and I am a penultimate-year, undergraduate student at the University of Queensland, enrolled in a Bachelor of Engineering (Hons), majoring in software engineering. This letter accompanies my application for the Software Developer Internship role at Optiver's Sydney office.

\vspace{18pt}

I'm extremely passionate about software and have been an active part of the Brisbane developer community for several years, volunteering at local conferences like YOW! and serving as a mentor for local branches of Django Girls, Node Girls and Robogals. During this time, I've also been an active member of my university's computing society (UQCS), where I was elected president for the 2019 academic year. This position saw my team and I organising events, partnering with sponsors, and moderating an active online community numbering in the thousands. I also serve as a research assistant in the Complex and Intelligent Systems Group at UQ, where I work on problems in automatic speech recognition and tutor intermediate courses on Java and systems programming.

\vspace{18pt}

I see Optiver, and this role specifically, as the perfect opportunity to apply my unique educational background in both software engineering and finance. My most satisfying work experiences have all come out of building valuable tools that make people more effective in their roles and drastically increase their output. Examples include accelerating the transcription of audio using automatic speech recognition at UQ, as well as my work at Canva, building tooling for the transpilation of infrastructure code to more accessible programming languages. I would love to have the opportunity to apply my experiences in this area to facilitating the work of Optiver's trading teams, where I would also have the advantage of a greater familiarity with the problem domain.

\vspace{18pt}

When I spoke to past Optiver interns towards the end of their time in the intern program earlier this year, I was left encouraged by their candid feedback on their time with the company. They reported feeling both challenged by their work and valued by their teams. I consider this to be high praise, particularly as it was unprompted. I am particularly attracted to that aspect of challenge. My greatest fear, when it comes to choosing a direction for my career, is that I end up in a role that isn't challenging.  From what I've heard and read, a position at Optiver is very unlikely to run that risk.

\vspace{18pt}

Thank you for taking the time to consider my application for this role. Should you require any further information, please contact me at any time via phone (0407 980 730) or email (nick@ndl.im).

\vspace{30pt}

Kind regards, \\

Nicholas Lambourne
