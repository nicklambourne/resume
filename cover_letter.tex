Dear TechnologyOne HR Team,

\vspace{30pt}

My name is Nicholas Lambourne and I am a penultimate-year, undergraduate student at the University of Queensland, enrolled in a Bachelor of Engineering (Hons) majoring in software engineering. This letter accompanies my application for the Intern Developer role at TechnologyOne in Brisbane.

\vspace{18pt}

TechnologyOne has been a supporter of the University of Queensland Computing Society for many years now, and as the president of UQCS for the 2019 academic year I had the joy of attending the TechOne Big Game for the first time this year. What I saw on that night impressed me a great deal, particularly the enthusiasm that your existing staff brought to the event. That passion, combined with the scope and scale of the problems that TechOne tackles on a daily basis, make for the kind of environment that I'm looking to work in long-term.

\vspace{18pt}

So you know why I want to work at TechOne, but why should you let me? Besides having a solid grasp on computer science fundamentals, I also have experience working in SMEs building software to solve problems (not dissimilar to TechOne). I've worked in start-ups on machine learning parallelisation strategies, and I'm currently engaged as a research assistant and tutor at UQ, working on automatic speech recognition problems and teaching Java, respectively. Between these responsibilities and running UQCS with my team, I don't get a lot of free time, but when I do I like to attend conferences and contribute to open-source (like the Python Beeware project). 

\vspace{18pt}

I'm passionate about continuing to learn and grow and I think that TechOne is somewhere that would foster that attitude. If you think, as I do, that there's something valuable that I could bring to your team, I'd be delighted to have the opportunity. 

\vspace{18pt}

Thank you for taking the time to consider my application for this role. Should you require any further information, please contact me at any time via phone (0407 980 730) or email (nick@ndl.im).

\vspace{30pt}

Kind regards, \\

Nicholas Lambourne
