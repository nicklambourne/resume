Dear Macquarie Talent Team,

\vspace{30pt}

My name is Nicholas Lambourne and I am a penultimate year undergraduate student at the University of Queensland, enrolled in a Bachelor of Engineering (Hons) majoring in software engineering. This letter accompanies my application for a position in the Winter Development Program with Macquarie Capital in Sydney.

\vspace{18pt}

Coming from a home where the last Thursday of the month was infamous for being options expiry, I've always been interested in finance. So much so that when I left high school I immediately enrolled in a Bachelor of Commerce, majoring in finance, at the University of Queensland. As that degree came to an end however, I found myself drawn to computer science and programming to such an extent that I knew I had to study it as well. It's my dream to be able to combine both of these passions in a single career, and it seems to me that there are few places better suited to provide such a career than Macquarie.

\vspace{18pt}

I believe that I'd be an asset Macquarie Capital not only for my unique educational background, but also due to my experiences working in SMEs, technology start-ups and large research organisations like the University of Queensland. I've also had the unique privilege to lead the University of Queensland Computing Society, a student group consisting of over 400 members that runs events twice per week focussing on industry engagement, teaching new technologies and enhancing the student experience for those in technology-based disciplines. These experiences have left me with something that you just can't teach in the classroom.

\vspace{18pt}

During my time in software engineering, I've also built up a technological skillset that complements my knowledge of financial material. As the world becomes more and more automated (finance in particular), the combination of handle on both disciplines becomes a significant asset. These skills, as well as an insatiable appetite for learning new skills and excelling in high-paced environments, are why I think I would make a good fit for Macquarie's winter program.

\vspace{18pt}

Thank you for taking the time to consider my application for this role. Should you require any further information, please contact me at any time via phone (0407 980 730) or email (nick@ndl.im).

Kind regards, \\
